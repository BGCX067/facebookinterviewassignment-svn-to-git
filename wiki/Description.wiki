Hi,

Attached is my code solution to the interesting puzzle. An actual PHP file. If it does not download, alert me. :-)

A few exciting points to note: -
 * If given more time, I would have written some form of error handling (sometimes the web service URLs go down) to prevent ugly error screen print. But that is just cosmetics. :-)
 * I could have extracted the username from the e-mail address and made that the student's name. But since "students are identified by their e-mail", that was left out to code the array handling.
 * Getting the stuff out is the easy part, forming all the associative and multidimensional arrays is the hard part. That took up like 80% of the coding time.
 * I could have documented the code a little more clearer. But I think most of the code is pretty self explanatory.
 * Awesome quiz! Great exercise for brain cells and logical thinking!
